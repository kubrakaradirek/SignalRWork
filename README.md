# Simple Chat Application Developed with ASP.NET SignalR

This project is a simple chat application developed on .NET 7.0 using ASP.NET SignalR. Users can log in and chat with each other in real time. Each user is assigned a random color based on their mouse position upon login, and this color can be tracked during mouse movements for different users. Each user's mouse movements are displayed in a different color, providing an interactive and dynamic experience.
